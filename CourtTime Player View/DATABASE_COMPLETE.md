## 🚀 Quick Commands

### Check Database Status
```bash
npm run db:check
```
This will show:
- Connection status
- All tables
- Facilities and courts count
- User count

### Re-run Database Setup (if needed)
```bash
npm run db:setup
```
This is **idempotent** - safe to run multiple times.

---

## 🔧 Connection Configuration

Your `.env` file is configured with:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.<project-ref>:<password>@<region>.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
```

**Why Session Pooler?**
- Your network is IPv4-only
- Supabase direct connection requires IPv6
- Session Pooler provides IPv4 compatibility
- Works seamlessly with all database operations

---

## 📝 Files Created

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. **Test the Application**
```bash
npm run dev
```
The app will work in DEV_MODE without database (mock user data).

### 2. **Create Your First User** (when ready)
You can use the authentication service:
```typescript
import { registerUser, loginUser } from './src/services/authService';

// Register
const result = await registerUser(
  'user@example.com',
  'securePassword123',
  'John Doe',
  'player'
);

// Login
const loginResult = await loginUser('user@example.com', 'securePassword123');
```

### 3. **Add Users to Facilities**
```typescript
import { addUserToFacility } from './src/services/authService';

await addUserToFacility(userId, 'sunrise-valley', 'Full');
```

### 4. **Switch to Real Database Authentication** (Optional)
Currently, the app uses DEV_MODE in `AuthContext.tsx`. When ready to use real database authentication:
1. Set `DEV_MODE = false` in `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
2. Update login/register functions to use `authService`
3. Handle JWT tokens or session management
